          <h2>What is Sequestration</h2>
          <h3>
            Sequestration is the Scottish term for Bankruptcy. It, like Trust
            Deeds, has its place in the debt solution market depending on your
            specific circumstance.
          </h3>
          <p>
            Many people we speak to tend to shy away from Bankruptcy, but it
            should not be discounted. Often is the case that people are just
            mis-informed about what Bankruptcy actually is and how it works. We
            are happy to explain the process in detail if you contact us.
            Alternatively, we have added a useful FAQ which might answer some of
            your questions. We have also set out some information below which
            you shall hopefully find useful.
          </p>
          <p>
            The period of Sequestration is currently 4 years, as with Trust
            Deeds. There are certain restrictions which apply to you when you
            enter Bankruptcy and those restrictions generally include:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>You cannot be a Director of a Limited Company;</li>
            <li>You cannot obtain credit while Bankrupt;</li>
            <li>
              You cannot sit, in most cases, in certain public office positions
              – such as a MSP or run for First Minister;
            </li>
            <li>
              Bankruptcy will affect your credit rating, however, you will be
              able to repair this in good time.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Bankruptcy is a formal means in which to attend to debts you are not
            able to pay. In order to declare yourself Bankrupt

              An application must be made and submitted to the Accountant in
              Bankruptcy. The Accountant in Bankruptcy is a Public Office and
              supervises the administration of all Bankruptcies and Trust Deeds
              in Scotland.

            In order to make an application for Bankruptcy, you must fulfill
            certain criteria. Such as:
          </h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              You must owe a total debt of at least £1,500, but no more than
              £17,000 for MAP. MAP is a Minimum Assets Process and will apply to
              you if your debts are under £17,000.00, a Money Adviser has deemed
              that you are not in a position to pay anything to your debts and
              you do not own any assets, such as a house.
            </li>
            <li>
              If your debts are over £17,000, or you own assets valuing £2,000
              or more, then you can only apply for bankruptcy under the full
              administration route. We can explain what this means in greater
              detail.
            </li>
            <li>You must have received money advice from a money adviser.</li>
            <li>
              You must be living in Scotland, have lived in Scotland or have
              established a place of business in Scotland, in the year
              immediately preceding the date of your application.
            </li>
            <li>You must not have been made bankrupt in the last 5 years.</li>
            <li>You must pay the application fee.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            When you make the application for Bankruptcy, which we can assist
            you with, you are able to either appoint a Private Trustee, such as
            an Insolvency Practitioner working at J3 Debt Solutions, or you can
            allow the Accountant in Bankruptcy to act as your Trustee.
